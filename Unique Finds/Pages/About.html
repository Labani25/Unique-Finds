        <p> Unique Finds is an online marketplace founded in 2022 with a vision to
revolutionise the way people shop for handmade, rare, and vintage products. The
idea was born from a simple yet powerful observation: mainstream e-commerce
platforms were saturated with mass-produced items, leaving little space for truly
unique, creative, and meaningful products. The founder, inspired by travel
experiences and encounters with local artisans across different countries,
recognised the need for a digital platform that would give smaller creators and
independent artists the exposure they deserved.
Initially starting as a small, curated shop on social media, Unique Finds quickly
gained traction among consumers looking for more personalised and ethically
sourced items. In just one year, the platform grew from a single-person startup
into a recognised online brand, partnering with over 100 artisans globally. Its
catalogue includes handmade jewellery, eco-friendly home d√©cor, custom art,
vintage collectibles, and other unique, story-driven products.
